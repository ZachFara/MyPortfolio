# Zachariah Farahany — Portfolio

Personal portfolio site: selected work, blog posts, and CV. Built as a React single-page app that is prerendered to static HTML at build time and served from GitHub Pages.

**Live site**: [zachfara.github.io/MyPortfolio](https://zachfara.github.io/MyPortfolio/)

## Tech Stack

- **React 19** with functional components and hooks
- **React Router 7** — `BrowserRouter` with a `/MyPortfolio` basename; a `404.html` [SPA redirect](https://github.com/rafgraph/spa-github-pages) keeps deep links working on GitHub Pages
- **Vite 7** for dev server and production builds
- **Shiki** for build-free syntax highlighting in blog posts
- **React Helmet** for per-page meta tags and titles
- **Vitest + React Testing Library** for tests; **ESLint 9** (flat config, zero-warnings policy)
- Plain CSS design system — no preprocessor

## Routes

| Path | Page |
|------|------|
| `/` | Home — intro plus featured work |
| `/work` | All projects and repositories (the former `/projects` and `/repositories` pages, now merged; both old paths redirect here) |
| `/cv` | Curriculum vitae |
| `/blog` | Blog index |
| `/blog/why-do-we-need-agents`, `/blog/ai-agent-memory` | Blog posts (React components in `src/pages/BlogPosts/`) |

Unknown paths fall back to Home.

```

## Styling

All visual styling lives in the dark design system under `src/styles/theme-dark/`, split into numbered layers (`00-tokens-base.css` through `90-scrollbars.css`) that `theme-dark.css` imports in order. It is loaded last in `main.jsx` so it owns the cascade. A handful of standalone stylesheets remain for the sidebar and hamburger menu; the other files in `src/styles/` are retired legacy overrides that are no longer imported.

## Getting Started

Requires Node.js 20+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZachFara/MyPortfolio.git
cd MyPortfolio
npm install          # or: npm ci --legacy-peer-deps
npm run dev          # http://localhost:5173
```

### Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start the dev server with hot reload |
| `npm run build` | Sync GitHub repo metadata, build the production bundle, then prerender all routes (via `postbuild`) |
| `npm run preview` | Serve the production build locally |
| `npm test` | Run the test suite once |
| `npm run test:watch` | Run tests in watch mode |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Generate a coverage report |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint with `--max-warnings=0` |
| `npm run sync:repo-updates` | Refresh `github-repo-updates.json` from the GitHub API (set `GITHUB_TOKEN` to avoid rate limits) |

## Build & Prerendering

`npm run build` does three things:

1. `sync:repo-updates` fetches the last-push date for every repo referenced in `workItems.js` and writes it to `src/data/generated/github-repo-updates.json`.
2. Vite builds the client bundle to `dist/`.
3. The `postbuild` hook builds an SSR bundle from `entry-server.jsx` and `scripts/prerender.mjs` renders each route to a static `index.html` under `dist/`, so pages arrive as real HTML and React hydrates on load.

## Testing

Vitest with React Testing Library; tests live in `tests/` mirroring `src/` (components, pages, and a Shiki code-styling test). The approach is smoke-test focused — render without crashing, key elements present — rather than asserting on styling or implementation details. See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for details.

## Deployment

GitHub Actions deploys to GitHub Pages on pushes to `master`:

- **`ci-cd.yml`** — lints and tests on every push and PR; on `master`, builds and deploys `dist/` to the `gh-pages` branch.
- **`static.yml`** — a simpler build-and-deploy workflow, also triggered on `master` pushes (and manually via `workflow_dispatch`).

The Vite `base` is `/MyPortfolio/` to match the Pages subdirectory, and `public/404.html` redirects unknown paths back into the SPA router.
